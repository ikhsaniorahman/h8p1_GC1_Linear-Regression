Download dataset here -> https://www.kaggle.com/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma

I wanna try to make a Linear Regression Model from the dataset, and see the compatibility between the two.


This is one of my exercises while on Hacktiv8, maybe there will be shortcomings in the process and analysis that I do. I really appreciate any advice given.
